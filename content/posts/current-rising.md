This week we got the chance to see an Opera in hyper reality. One of the benefits of working in an arts organisation like the Royal Opera House is the chance to occasionaly see behind the scenes. On Tuesday last we were given just that oppurtunity as we were amongst the first to experience the 'worldâ€™s first opera in hyperreality'. 

[Current Rising](https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/current-rising-details) is a 15 minute virtual reality experience that allows groups to enter into an immersive world initally together and through the magic of a VR move through a series of virtual environments that include an M.C Escher like room, a lonely island surrounded by music and sweeping building scapes.

It was really interesting being able to see my three other collegues as etheral avatars who at times were in the same enviroment as me and at others were seen to move away from or towards me as we experinced elements 'alone'. I was skeptical of how immersed I would be in any virtual enviroment but I was definitely wary of stepping to the edge of the various viewing platforms we were transported around. 

It was also great being back in the office. It was a great excuse to come into town and to see the building and our collegues both those setting up for a new run and those waiting to be brought through the experience. I've always bragged about working in a office that workwise for me is all computer screens and meetings but also has dancers, performers, ushers and stage staff all working together to make the ROH the place it is.
