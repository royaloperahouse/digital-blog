We want to do justice to the spectacular opera and ballet performances that are recorded and streamed from Covent Garden, by focusing hard on quality (audio and video capture and encoding; low latency streaming; player optimisations) and by reducing as much friction as possible between our passionate audience and our wonderful content.</description></item></channel></rss>
