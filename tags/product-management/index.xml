      <description>The term ‘MVP’ or &amp;lsquo;minimum viable product&amp;rsquo; is one that you can’t escape from in the modern digital age, and in our work in designing the new Royal Opera House TV streaming app its definitely a useful term. As a bit of background, the need for a TV app became apparent when we find that large numbers of our users were struggling to get casting to work. I find that a pretty easy to understand problem - I’ve been using Apple TV since they started, and Apple are meant to get these things right, but even trying to get an iPhone to cast reliably to an Apple TV is a bit of a hit and miss experience.</description>
